/**
Project 1: The Pet Class
Problem Description: 
	 Create a class named Pet. 
1.	Analysis: 
	Some String data fields named name, species, breed, gender
	Some String Array data fields named color, character
	A constructor that creates a Pet for no information
	A constructor that creates a Pet for all the information
	The methods isDog() and isMale() that return true if the Pet is dog and male respectively. 
	The methods containColor(color) and containCharacter(character) that return true if the Pet contains such color and character respectively. 
2. Design: 
	Make a UML class diagram for it. 
3. Coding and Testing:
	(Do not forget to Test it)

4. Submit:
	Compress all your work in to a Zip file and submit it to BlackBoard.

/**
Project 3: The MyDate Class
Problem Description:
	Design a class named MyDate.
1.	Analysis: 
	The data fields year, month and day that represent a date. (1 for January)
	A no-arg constructor that creates a MyDate object for the current date. 
	A constructor that constructs a My Date object with a specified elapsed time since midnight, January 1, 1970, in milliseconds. 
	A constructor that constructs a MyDate object with the specified year, month, and day. 
	Three get methods for the data fields year, month, and day, respectively.
	A method named setDate(long elapsedTime) that sets a new date for the object using the elapsed time. 
2. Design
Draw the UML diagram for the calss. 
(You may use the GregorianCalendar class to simplify your code.)
3. Coding and Testing:
	(Do not forget to Test it)
Write a Test class that creates two MyDate objects using three different kinds of constructors and displays their year, month and day. 
For Example:
